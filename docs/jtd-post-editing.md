# Post-editing  

Post-editing is the process in which humans amend machine-generated translations to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is called a post-editor. The concept of post-editing is closely linked to pre-editing. In machine translation, the best results are often achieved by pre-editing the source text — for example, by applying controlled language principles — before post-editing the machine-generated output.  

Post-editing is distinct from editing, which refers to the process of improving human-generated text (often called revision in translation). After post-editing, the text may undergo further revision to ensure the quality of language choices and to proofread for simple mistakes.  

Post-editing involves the correction of machine translation output to ensure that it meets a level of quality negotiated in advance between the client and the post-editor.  

- **Light post-editing** aims at making the output simply understandable.  
- **Full post-editing** aims at making it also stylistically appropriate.  

With advances in machine translation, full post-editing is becoming an alternative to manual translation. Practically all computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools now support post-editing of machine-translated output.
