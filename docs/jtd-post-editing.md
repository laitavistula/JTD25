# Post-editing

Post-editing is the process of humans amending machine-generated translations to achieve an acceptable final product. A person who post-edits is known as a post-editor. The concept of post-editing is closely linked to pre-editing, as the best results in machine translation are often achieved by pre-editing the source text—such as by applying controlled language principles—before post-editing the machine-generated output.

Post-editing is distinct from editing, which refers to the process of improving human-generated text (often called revision in translation). After post-editing, the text may undergo further revision to ensure the quality of language choices and to proofread for simple mistakes.

Post-editing involves correcting machine translation output to ensure that it meets a level of quality that has been agreed upon in advance between the client and the post-editor.

- **Light post-editing** aims to make the output simply understandable.
- **Full post-editing** aims to make the output not only understandable but also stylistically appropriate.

With advances in machine translation, full post-editing is becoming an alternative to manual translation. Practically all computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools now support post-editing of machine-translated output.
