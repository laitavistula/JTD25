# Pre-editing  

Pre-editing involves preparing a document before applying machine translation to it. The primary goal is to reduce the post-editing workload by adapting the source text to enhance the quality of the machine translation output. Pre-editing can also benefit human translation projects by increasing the efficiency of translation memory systems.  

In general, pre-editing is particularly valuable when translating into more than three target languages. In such cases, it can streamline the machine translation process by ensuring the following:  

- Correct spelling and grammar.  
- Simplified and unambiguous syntactic structures.  
- Consistent terminology.  

Pre-editing is also useful for poorly converted files, where formatting or text issues might disrupt the translation process. While formatting pre-editing is important, linguistic pre-editing takes priority, as language errors have a more significant impact on machine translation quality.
