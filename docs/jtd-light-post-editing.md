# Light and Full Post-editing

For many years, there were no widely accepted standardized guidelines for post-editing. However, in 2017, ISO standard **18587:2017: Translation Services — Post-editing of Machine Translation Output — Requirements** was published, outlining the requirements for post-editing machine-generated translations.

In the 1980s, studies differentiated between various levels of post-editing, initially categorized as "conventional" and "rapid," or "full" and "rapid," in the context of the European Commission Translation Service. Today, the terms **"light"** and **"full"** post-editing are more commonly used.

## Light Post-editing

Light post-editing involves minimal intervention by the post-editor, aiming to ensure that the output is "good enough" or "understandable." This type of post-editing is often used when the text is needed urgently or within a short timeframe, and the client intends to use it for inbound purposes only.

## Full Post-editing

Full post-editing requires a higher level of intervention to achieve quality that meets an agreed standard between the client and the post-editor. The expectation is that the final output will not only be understandable but also stylistically appropriate, suitable for both inbound and outbound purposes. This results in text that is publishable and of quality equivalent to human translation.

Traditionally, it was assumed that translating directly from the source text required less effort than post-editing machine-generated content. However, with advancements in machine translation, this assumption may no longer hold. In certain cases, particularly with language pairs and tasks involving engines customized with high-quality, domain-specific data, some clients are already opting for post-editing instead of translation from scratch, believing it offers comparable quality at a lower cost.

The light/full classification, developed in the 1990s when machine translation was limited to CD-ROMs, may no longer fully reflect the capabilities of modern machine translation, especially at the light post-editing end. For some language pairs and tasks, particularly when the source text has been pre-edited, raw machine output may be sufficient for gisting purposes without requiring significant human intervention.
